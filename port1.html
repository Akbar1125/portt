    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Akbar Ali, a passionate and dedicated Mechanical Engineering student with a strong interest in technological innovation, sustainability, and real-world problem solving. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a solid foundation in core engineering principles, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and manufacturing processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My curiosity and creativity have driven me to explore various interdisciplinary domains like automation, mechatronics, and design optimization. I believe engineering is not just about machines and mechanics — it's about innovation, efficiency, and impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my technical skills, I take pride in being a team player and an excellent communicator. I actively engage in collaborative projects and thrive in environments where critical thinking and hands-on application intersect. I am currently working on a river garbage cleaning project, aiming to make a difference through engineering for environmental sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Qualification: MHT CET</strong>  I scored a percentile of 95.8 %ile in the MHT CET, reflecting my strong grasp of core engineering principles and problem-solving abilities.
